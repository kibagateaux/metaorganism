Title: The MetaOrganism DAOFramework

Abstract:

The MetaOrganism framework is designed to facilitate the formation and operation of diverse human groups, ranging from local community gatherings to large-scale corporations and government services. MetaOrgs act dynamic and adaptable organisms, allowing for a more sustainable and equitable interaction with the ever-changing environment of human society. It aims to cover the entire life cycle of human groups, enable customization of processes, promote non-hierarchical delegation of roles and responsibilities, and discusses the rationale behind its design, as well as its pros and cons.

1. Life Cycle of Organisms:

## General Concept
- Follows the lifecycle of a community/idea/startup/DAO and creates a biomimetic DAO framework for actualizing it
- No reason to write smart contracts (aka DAOs) directly anymore. Everything will be a smart account with customizable plugins and modules. 
- Panspermia is all free functions and variables because those are the random building blocks of life, not even organized into a single structure yet.
- focus on what vs why at different times. Initially, focus on why, then what, then what, then why, etc.
- supports different operating models, decision maing frameworks, ideological preferences, etc. for each stage of life
- multi-dimensional interconnected framework where metaorgs can spawn new ones, join old ones, merging with others, etc.
- Codifies different types of roles throughout the org from vision to operations, both in terms of what they do and when they can do it
- Meta layer ontop of existing DAO frameworks - can have a moloch DAO in early stages and seamlessly transfer to GovernorBravo for scaling
- ensuring that they evolve, learn, and remain relevant in the complex and ever-changing social environment.
- implicite right to exit in mitosis and grace period between any phase change start and end where `currentLifecycle` isnt updated yet.
- Every MetaOrg is a cell of another MetaOrg. Only difference is if its a subcell or peercell. Subcells are required to have a parent MetaOrg that controls its TopHat vs peercells are independent and control their own TopHat. (maybe rename ecto/endo cells)

## Account Abstraction
- Figure out how to use Safe{Core}
- Every MetaOrg should be a SmartAccount. Souls should be Modules/Plugins?
- Souls return SafeActions/SafeTransactions for MetaOrg to execute
- Abstract more logic/patterns into Souls


## Questions To Ask With Code
- what does a decompostion rate look like? Does it affect max amount of resource sthat can be taken at once by an entity? Dont want it to be too low bc than full amount cant get ragequit. Or feature? Like a way to prevent a hostile takeover? Is it one constant per MetaOrg or updatable by X or per Soul?
