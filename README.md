Title: The Organismic Social Coordination System

Abstract:

The MetaOrg framework is designed to facilitate the formation and operation of diverse human groups, ranging from local community gatherings to large-scale corporations and government services. MetaOrgs act dynamic and adaptable organisms, allowing for a more sustainable and equitable interaction with the ever-changing environment of human society. It aims to cover the entire life cycle of human groups, enable customization of processes, promote non-hierarchical delegation of roles and responsibilities, and discusses the rationale behind its design, as well as its pros and cons.

1. Life Cycle of Organisms:

OSCS is rooted in the abstract concept of the life cycle, recognizing that everything, from celestial bodies to microorganisms, follows patterns of birth, growth, adaptation, reproduction, and eventual transformation or decay. The OSCS framework adapts this concept to human groups, ensuring that they evolve, learn, and remain relevant in the complex and ever-changing social environment.
